4. Present a clear and structured recommendation on suitable career paths.
5. Explain the recommendation using basic Game Theory concepts:
    - Strategic choices
    - Payoff matrix (briefly)
    - Dominant strategies or equilibria

Make sure the explanation is simple and easy for a student to understand.
